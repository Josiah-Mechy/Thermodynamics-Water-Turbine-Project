# Thermodynamics-Water-Turbine-Project
Designed and built a scale model of a water-driven turbine that converts water flow into mechanical energy. The turbine drives a two-gear system to power a light, demonstrating energy conversion, power transmission, and efficiency through design, assembly, and testing under varying flow conditions.

## Overview

This project involved designing and building a working scale model of a water-driven turbine to demonstrate principles of energy conversion and thermodynamics. The turbine converts the kinetic energy of flowing water into mechanical energy via a shaft and gear system.
