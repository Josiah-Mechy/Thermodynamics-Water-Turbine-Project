# Thermodynamics-Water-Turbine-Project
Designed and built a scale model of a water-driven turbine that converts water flow into mechanical energy. The turbine drives a two-gear system to power a light, demonstrating energy conversion, power transmission, and efficiency through design, assembly, and testing under varying flow conditions.
