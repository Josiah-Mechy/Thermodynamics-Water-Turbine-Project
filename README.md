# Thermodynamics-Water-Turbine-Project

## Overview

Designed and built a scale model of a water-driven turbine that converts water flow into mechanical energy. The turbine drives a two-gear system to power a light, demonstrating energy conversion, power transmission, and efficiency through design, assembly, and testing under varying flow conditions.

## Key Features

- Functional scale model of a water turbine  
- Two-gear transmission system attached to the turbine shaft  
- Demonstrates mechanical power transfer and rotational motion  
- Designed to analyze efficiency and performance under different water flow conditions
